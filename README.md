# The Blender 2.9 Creative Series: 3D Modelling for Beginners

## Section 3: Geometry Nodes In Blender

#### You will be able to use and navigate the Geometry Nodes workspace, have a deep understanding of the key nodes, and will be able to create both tools and entire models procedurally!

>### 1 Welcome to the Section
---
>### 2 Setting Up Blender
>+ How to enable the **Node Wrangler** addon.
---
>### 3 The Workspace and Shortcuts
>+ Understanding the different editors in the workspace.
>+ Basic actions in the node editor:
>+ Pan with `MMB`
>+ Zoom with `Scroll Wheel`
>+ Add new nodes with `CTRL + A`
>+ Duplicate nodes with `SHIFT + D` or `CTRL + SHIFT + D`
>+ Some common **Node Wrangler** shortcuts:
>+ View a node with `CTRL + SHIFT + LMB`
>+ Lazy Connect two nodes with `ALT + RMB`
>+ Cut noodles with `CTRL + RMB`
>+ Create a reroute with `SHIFT + RMB` 
>+ And more..
---
### 4 A First Scatter
>+ How to use the **Point Distribute** and **Point Instance** nodes.
>+ Using attributes to randomise the `scale` and `rotation` of instances.
---
### 5 The Modifier as a Tool
>+ How to expose variables on the front of the modifier.
>+ How to import a Geometry Nodes setup to a new file.
---
### 6 Adding Materials
>+ How to add materials to the base object, instances, or generated meshes.
---
### 7 Understanding Attributes
>+ How to use Attributes
>+ What is a `Built-In` vs `Named` vs `Custom` attribute
---
### 8 Understanding Instances
>+ What are Instances?
>+ When do Instances get calculated as "real" geometry?
---
### 9 Introduction to the Fairy Ring Scene
>+ How assets are arranged in collections.
>+ How a shader trick has been used to add colour variation to instances.
---
### 10 Instance from a Collection
>+ How to instance random objects from a collection using the **Point Instance** node.
---
### 11 Wind I: Introducing Textures
>+ How to use the **Attribute Sample Texture** and **Attribute Colour Ramp** nodes.
>+ How to use the Texture Properties Panel.
---
### 12 Wind II: Animating with Drivers
>+ How to use the driver `#frame` to animate values.
---
### 13 Wind III: Relative Rotations
>+ How to change rotation without losing the current `rotation` attribute using the **Point Rotate** node.
---
### 14 Controlling Density with Vertex Groups
>+ Using **Poisson Disk** on the **Point Distribute** node.
>+ How to use Vertex Groups to control point distribution.
---
### 15 Instancing on Vertices
>+ How to use Mesh Primitive nodes to create meshes.
>+ How to manipulate meshes with the **Transform** node.
>+ How to instance directly on vertices without a **Point Distribute** node.
---
### 16 The Attribute Proximity Node
>+ How to use the **Attribute Proximity** node to create interactions between assets.
>+ How to use the **Attribute Map Range** node to control falloff.
---
### 17 Deforming Geometry
>+ How to displace geometry inside Geometry Nodes using a texture.
---
### 18 Making Random Selections
>+ How to use the **Attribute Compare** node with the **Point Separate** node to mask points.
---
### 19 Creating a Billboard Effect
>+ How to make assets always point towards the camera.
>+ Introducing more objects to the node tree with the **Object Info** node.
>+ Creating a "Track To" style setup using the **Align Rotation to Vector** node.
---
### 20 BONUS: A Perfect Animation Loop
>+ Using more advanced drivers to create a perfect looped animation.
>+ `#sin(frame/250*tau)` and `#cos(frame/250*tau)` where there are 250 frames in total.
---
>### 21 Extra Challenges and Wrap Up
>+ Well done on getting this far!
>+ Extra challenges to help consolidate the lessons so far.
>+ If you haven't yet, I'd love to see your progress.
>+ Any feedback? Let us know.
